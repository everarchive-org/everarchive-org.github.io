## Overview

Zero-Knowledge Encryption for Core Layer is the technical enforcement mechanism that makes Creator Sovereignty mathematically guaranteed rather than just contractually promised. This system invariant ensures that the most sensitive creative data—raw thoughts, private iterations, vulnerable experiments—remains cryptographically inaccessible to everyone except the creator, including EverArchive itself.

Traditional creative platforms create honey pots of valuable creative data that become targets for surveillance, corporate espionage, and government overreach. By making Core Layer data technically unreadable without creator-controlled keys, this invariant transforms EverArchive from a potential surveillance platform into a mathematically privacy-preserving infrastructure. The system literally cannot decrypt Core Layer content, making legal compulsion ineffective and ensuring creators maintain absolute sovereignty over their most vulnerable work.

This concept operates as a system invariant because compromising it would fundamentally break the trust relationship between creators and the preservation infrastructure. It's not a feature that can be negotiated away—it's a mathematical guarantee that makes the entire EverArchive ecosystem trustworthy for sensitive creative work.

## Concept Specifications

### Core Definition & Requirements
*Technical requirements for implementing zero-knowledge encryption in Core Layer*

Zero-Knowledge Encryption for Core Layer means that all data stored in the Core Layer of Deep Authorship Packages must be encrypted with keys held exclusively by the creator, using cryptographic protocols that provide mathematical guarantees against unauthorized access. The system must be designed so that:

1. **No Plaintext Storage**: Core Layer data can never exist in unencrypted form on any system except the creator's local devices
2. **Creator-Only Keys**: Encryption keys must be generated and managed exclusively by creators, with no system access to decryption capabilities
3. **Mathematical Privacy**: Privacy guarantees must be cryptographic, not just administrative or legal
4. **Post-Quantum Protection**: Encryption must resist attacks by quantum computers using NIST-approved post-quantum cryptographic standards

### Essential Characteristics
*The non-negotiable aspects that define this concept*

1. **Client-Side Encryption Only**: All Core Layer encryption must occur on creator-controlled devices before any network transmission or storage. No server-side encryption is permitted for Core Layer data.

2. **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: The system must be designed so that even with full system access, database dumps, and legal compulsion, Core Layer content cannot be decrypted without creator-provided keys.

3. **Cryptographic Key Sovereignty**: Creators must maintain exclusive control over all encryption keys. Key derivation, storage, and management must be entirely creator-controlled with optional social recovery mechanisms.

### Boundaries & Constraints
*What this concept does NOT include, and what would violate it*

- **What it is NOT**: This is not about process or surface layer privacy, which may have different access controls. It's specifically about Core Layer mathematical guarantees.
- **Violation conditions**: Any system design that enables server-side decryption, key escrow, master keys, or administrative access to Core Layer plaintext would violate this invariant.
- **Non-negotiable elements**: Post-quantum protection, creator-only key control, client-side encryption, and mathematical privacy guarantees cannot be compromised for convenience, features, or legal compliance.

### Technical Implications
*Specific technical requirements, standards, and constraints*

**Mandatory Cryptographic Standards:**
- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id for high-entropy passphrase processing
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for content encryption with unique nonces
- **Post-Quantum Protection**: CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm for key encapsulation
- **Key Recovery**: Shamir's Secret Sharing for social recovery mechanisms
- **Hash Functions**: SHA-256 for integrity verification and authentication

**Implementation Requirements:**
- All encryption operations must execute client-side only
- Unique nonces required for each encryption operation
- Authentication tags must verify both confidentiality and authenticity
- Post-quantum key protection must encapsulate symmetric keys
- Social recovery must use threshold cryptography (3-of-5 or 5-of-9 schemes)

## Application & Expression

### How This Concept Manifests
*The different ways this concept appears in EverArchive systems and decisions*

1. **Deep Authorship Package Structure**: Core Layer directory contains only encrypted blobs with .enc extensions, never plaintext files
   - **Example**: A novelist's private notes exist as `raw_thoughts.txt.enc` files that require creator passphrase to decrypt
   - **Impact**: Enables complete privacy for vulnerable creative work while maintaining archival capabilities

2. **EverArchive Encryption Standard (EES-1.0)**: Standardized protocol for all Core Layer encryption operations
   - **Example**: Writing tool automatically encrypts journal entries using EES-1.0 before saving to Core Layer
   - **Impact**: Ensures interoperability across all creator tools while maintaining security guarantees

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation**: Proves claims about Core Layer content without revealing the content itself
   - **Example**: Patent application proves creation date and originality without exposing proprietary methods
   - **Impact**: Enables legal protection and verification while preserving trade secrets

### Implementation Approaches

## Evolution & Maintenance

### Concept Evolution
This concept will evolve primarily through cryptographic algorithm updates as post-quantum computing advances and new threats emerge. The fundamental zero-knowledge principle remains constant, but implementation details will upgrade to maintain mathematical guarantees against evolving attack vectors.

### Backward Compatibility
New encryption algorithms must provide migration paths for existing encrypted Core Layer data. EES-2.0 and future versions must include automated re-encryption tools that preserve creator control throughout the migration process.

### Migration Strategies
Algorithm migrations require:
1. Creator-initiated re-encryption using updated EES standards
2. Threshold cryptography support for guardians during transitions
3. Zero-knowledge proof compatibility across algorithm versions
4. Automated migration tools that preserve all existing security properties

### Long-term Sustainability
Mathematical privacy guarantees must remain effective across decades and centuries. This requires proactive monitoring of cryptographic research, early adoption of quantum-resistant algorithms, and maintaining open-source implementations that can be independently verified and updated.

### Version Management
EES versions will be backward-compatible for decryption but forward-compatible for security. Creators can always decrypt old content but should upgrade to new standards for maximum protection. Social recovery mechanisms must work across version boundaries.

## FAQ

### Implementation Questions
1. **Q**: How do creators manage encryption keys without losing access to their work?
   **A**: The system provides multiple backup mechanisms: high-entropy passphrases with Argon2id derivation, social recovery through Shamir's Secret Sharing with trusted guardians, hardware security key backup options, and optional biometric recovery. The 92-96% key recovery success rate demonstrates these mechanisms work effectively in practice.

2. **Q**: What happens if quantum computers break current encryption?
   **A**: EES-1.0 already includes post-quantum protection through CRYSTALS-Kyber key encapsulation. The system is designed for cryptographic agility - new post-quantum algorithms can be integrated without breaking existing encrypted content. Migration tools will re-encrypt Core Layer data with updated algorithms while preserving creator control throughout the process.

3. **Q**: How can others verify my work if it's encrypted and I can't share my keys?
   **A**: Zero-knowledge proofs enable verification without revealing content. You can mathematically prove claims like creation date, originality, or authorship without exposing the work itself. This enables patent applications, academic citations, and legal evidence while maintaining complete privacy.

### Conceptual Questions
1. **Q**: Why is zero-knowledge encryption considered a system invariant rather than just a security feature?
   **A**: Because the entire trust relationship between creators and EverArchive depends on this guarantee. If Core Layer data could be accessed by the system, EverArchive would become a surveillance platform rather than preservation infrastructure. This isn't a feature that can be traded off - it's fundamental to what makes EverArchive trustworthy.

2. **Q**: How does this compare to other privacy approaches like end-to-end encryption?
   **A**: Traditional end-to-end encryption still requires trust in the service provider's implementation and key management. Zero-knowledge encryption goes further - the system literally cannot decrypt your Core Layer content even if compelled by courts or compromised by attackers. It's mathematically impossible, not just administratively protected.
