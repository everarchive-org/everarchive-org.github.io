## Overview

The Deep Authorship 3-Layer Model is the foundational architectural pattern that organizes creative memory into three distinct layers of varying privacy, refinement, and intent. This model addresses the fundamental problem that binary "private/public" choices fail to capture the nuanced reality of human creative expression, where thoughts evolve from raw internal streams through iterative refinement to polished presentations.

This architectural primitive transforms EverArchive from a simple backup system into a sophisticated memory preservation infrastructure by recognizing and technically implementing the psychological reality of layered creative cognition. The model enables creators to preserve their complete creative journey while maintaining granular control over what aspects of their process they share and with whom.

The 3-Layer Model serves as the structural foundation for the entire EverArchive ecosystem, driving technical architecture decisions, user interface patterns, access control systems, and discovery algorithms. Without this model, EverArchive would be indistinguishable from conventional document storage systems.

## Concept Specifications

### Core Definition & Requirements

The Deep Authorship 3-Layer Model organizes creative memory into three hierarchical layers that mirror the natural progression of human creative thought:

**Core Layer**: The private, unfiltered internal monologue of the creative process. This layer contains raw thoughts, doubts, breakthrough moments, emotional context, and vulnerable cognitive states. It represents the creator's most authentic creative self before any external filtering or self-censorship.

**Process Layer**: The semi-private evolutionary journey showing how ideas develop and transform. This layer documents iterations, abandoned approaches, collaboration discussions, external influences, and the methodology behind creative decisions. It bridges the gap between private thoughts and public presentation.

**Surface Layer**: The public, polished artifacts intended for sharing. This layer contains final works, published versions, and presentation-ready materials that represent the creator's intended public expression of their creative work.

### Essential Characteristics

1. **Hierarchical Privacy Structure**: Each layer has distinct access controls, with Core requiring zero-knowledge encryption, Process allowing selective sharing, and Surface enabling public distribution according to creator preferences.

2. **Temporal Continuity**: The model preserves the temporal relationship between layers, maintaining timestamps and causal connections that show how thoughts evolve from Core through Process to Surface manifestations.

3. **Emotional Context Preservation**: Each layer captures not just content but emotional metadata, enabling future understanding of the psychological context that shaped creative decisions and breakthrough moments.

### Boundaries & Constraints

- **What it is NOT**: This is not a traditional file organization system or simple privacy categorization. It's a cognitive architecture that must reflect psychological reality.
- **Violation conditions**: Any implementation that collapses layers, allows unauthorized cross-layer access, or fails to preserve temporal relationships violates the model's fundamental purpose.
- **Non-negotiable elements**: Zero-knowledge encryption for Core Layer, creator sovereignty over layer boundaries, and preservation of emotional context are absolutely required.

### Technical Implications

The 3-Layer Model directly drives the Deep Authorship Package (DAP) format structure, requiring:
- Separate directory structures for each layer (`core/`, `process/`, `surface/`)
- Distinct encryption schemes per layer (mandatory encryption for Core, optional for Process, plaintext for Surface)
- Layer-specific metadata schemas that capture temporal and emotional context
- Access control mechanisms that respect layer boundaries while enabling cross-layer discovery

## Application & Expression

### How This Concept Manifests

1. **DAP Format Structure**: The model manifests as the canonical directory structure within Deep Authorship Packages
   - **Example**: A writer's DAP contains encrypted journal entries in `core/`, draft revisions in `process/`, and published story in `surface/`
   - **Impact**: Enables complete creative journey preservation while maintaining privacy granularity

2. **User Interface Design**: All EverArchive tools must reflect layer-aware interaction patterns
   - **Example**: Creator tools show distinct visual representations for each layer with appropriate privacy indicators
   - **Impact**: Users understand and control their creative exposure level instinctively

3. **Discovery Architecture**: Search and recommendation systems operate differently across layers
   - **Example**: Core Layer content only discoverable by creator, Process Layer enables selective collaborator access, Surface Layer supports public semantic search
   - **Impact**: Balances openness with privacy while enabling meaningful creative connections

### Implementation Approaches

**Approach 1: File System Implementation**
- **Context**: Local creator tools and DAP package creation
- **Method**: 
  ```
  my-creative-work/
  ├── core/           # AES-256-GCM encrypted files
  ├── process/        # Selective encryption based on sharing rules
  └── surface/        # Plaintext public files
  ```
- **Benefits**: Direct mapping to psychological model, clear boundaries, familiar paradigms
- **Considerations**: Must enforce encryption requirements and prevent accidental exposure

**Approach 2: Database Layer Implementation**
- **Context**: EverArchive discovery and indexing systems
- **Method**: 
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE creative_content (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      creator_did TEXT,
      layer_type ENUM('core', 'process', 'surface'),
      content_hash TEXT,
      encrypted_content BYTEA,
      access_policy JSONB,
      created_at TIMESTAMP,
      emotional_context JSONB
  );
  ```
- **Benefits**: Enables efficient querying across layers while maintaining security
- **Considerations**: Must implement proper access controls and encryption key management

**Approach 3: API Design Implementation**
- **Context**: Developer tools and integrations
- **Method**: 
  ```javascript
  // Layer-aware API endpoints
  POST /api/content/core        // Always encrypted
  POST /api/content/process     // Selective encryption
  POST /api/content/surface     // Public with permissions
  
  GET /api/content/{id}?layer=surface  // Layer-specific access
  ```
- **Benefits**: Enables third-party development while enforcing layer boundaries
- **Considerations**: Must validate layer access permissions and prevent privilege escalation

### Decision-Making Applications

- **Feature Development**: Every new EverArchive feature must consider how it respects and enhances the 3-Layer Model rather than conflicting with it
- **Partnership Integration**: External systems must map their data models to the 3-Layer structure or use Schema Projector translation
- **Governance Policies**: All platform policies must account for the different privacy expectations and use cases of each layer

### Common Misapplications

- **Layer Collapse**: Treating all three layers as equivalent privacy levels or merging them into binary private/public categories
- **Temporal Ignorance**: Implementing the layers as static categories rather than preserving the temporal flow between them
- **Emotional Stripping**: Focusing only on content without preserving the emotional context that gives meaning to the creative journey

## Dependencies & Relationships

### Depends On
- **[[🧑‍🎨 Distributed Creatives/♾️ EverArchive/💎 Codex/Tome I - Vision/1.3-Principles/foundations/05-creator-sovereignty]]**: The 3-Layer Model requires absolute creator control over layer boundaries and access permissions
- **[[🧑‍🎨 Distributed Creatives/♾️ EverArchive/💎 Codex/Tome I - Vision/1.3-Principles/foundations/08-zero-knowledge-encryption-for-core-layer]]**: Technical enforcement of Core Layer privacy is mandatory for model integrity

### Enables
- **[[🧑‍🎨 Distributed Creatives/♾️ EverArchive/💎 Codex/Tome I - Vision/1.3-Principles/foundations/02-deep-authorship-package-dap-format]]**: The DAP format is the direct technical expression of the 3-Layer Model
- **[[Progressive Trust and Sovereignty]]**: The layer structure enables creators to gradually share more as trust develops

### Feature Integration
- **Creative Control Features**: Use layer boundaries to implement granular privacy controls and sharing permissions
- **Discovery Features**: Implement layer-aware search that respects privacy while enabling meaningful connections
- **Preservation Features**: Ensure all three layers receive appropriate preservation treatment based on their sensitivity

### Cross-Concept Interactions

The 3-Layer Model works synergistically with Memory vs. Backup Paradigm to create a preservation system that captures meaning rather than just files. Combined with Creator Sovereignty, it enables trust-based sharing where creators can gradually reveal their process as relationships develop. The model's temporal structure supports Process over Product philosophy by making the creative journey as important as the final outcome.

### Institutional Adoption Patterns
Institutions typically adopt the 3-Layer Model by starting with Surface Layer preservation (matching existing practices), then gradually implementing Process Layer capture as they recognize its value for institutional memory, and finally adopting Core Layer preservation for high-value creators who require maximum trust and privacy protection.

## Validation & Assessment

### How to Recognize Proper Implementation

1. **Clear Layer Boundaries**: Each layer has distinct privacy characteristics and access controls that cannot be bypassed or collapsed
2. **Temporal Preservation**: The system maintains and displays the temporal relationships between layers, showing how thoughts evolve from Core through Process to Surface
3. **Emotional Context Capture**: Implementation includes mechanisms for capturing and preserving the emotional context that shaped creative decisions at each layer

### Assessment Questions

- **Does the implementation preserve the psychological reality of creative thought?** A proper implementation should feel natural to creators and match their intuitive understanding of their own creative process
- **Are layer boundaries technically enforced?** The system must prevent unauthorized cross-layer access and maintain encryption requirements for appropriate layers
- **Does the system capture temporal and emotional context?** Implementation should preserve not just content but the context that makes creative memory meaningful

### Warning Signs

- **Binary Privacy Thinking**: Any implementation that reduces the three layers to simple "private/public" categories has missed the model's essential purpose
- **Static Layer Treatment**: Treating layers as fixed categories rather than preserving the dynamic flow between them indicates fundamental misunderstanding
- **Content Without Context**: Focusing only on preserving files without capturing the emotional and temporal context that gives them meaning

### Measurement Approaches

- **Layer Utilization Metrics**: Track how creators use each layer to ensure the model matches real creative workflows
- **Privacy Boundary Violations**: Monitor for any unauthorized cross-layer access or encryption failures
- **Temporal Context Preservation**: Measure how well the system maintains and displays the relationships between layers over time

## Evolution & Maintenance

### Concept Evolution
The 3-Layer Model's essential structure remains constant, but its implementation may evolve to support new media types, enhanced emotional context capture, and improved privacy technologies. Any evolution must preserve the psychological reality the model represents.

### Backward Compatibility
All DAP format versions must maintain the three-layer structure to ensure content created today remains accessible and meaningful in the future. New features can enhance layer functionality but cannot eliminate layer boundaries.

### Migration Strategies
When migrating existing content to the 3-Layer Model, systems should analyze content patterns to make educated guesses about layer placement while providing creators with tools to refine categorization over time.

### Long-term Sustainability
The model's sustainability depends on maintaining its connection to psychological reality. As understanding of creative cognition evolves, the model's implementation may be refined, but its essential three-layer structure reflects fundamental aspects of human creative thought.

### Version Management
Different versions of the 3-Layer Model implementation must maintain interoperability while allowing for enhanced features. Version management focuses on preserving layer boundaries and temporal relationships across all implementations.

## FAQ

### Implementation Questions
1. **Q**: How do I handle content that doesn't fit neatly into one layer?
   **A**: Content should be placed in the most restrictive layer that matches its sensitivity. If content spans multiple layers, it can be cross-referenced with appropriate access controls for each layer.

2. **Q**: Can creators change layer assignments after content is created?
   **A**: Yes, creators maintain sovereignty over their layer assignments. However, systems should track these changes for provenance and ensure any sharing that has already occurred respects the original layer boundaries.

3. **Q**: How do I implement the model for non-text content like audio or video?
   **A**: The model applies to all creative media. Audio might have private voice notes (Core), work sessions (Process), and final recordings (Surface). Video might have personal reflections (Core), rough cuts (Process), and final productions (Surface).

### Conceptual Questions
1. **Q**: Why not just use traditional privacy controls instead of three layers?
   **A**: Traditional binary privacy fails to capture the reality of creative thought, which exists in gradients of refinement and sharing intention. The three layers reflect how creators actually think about their work.

2. **Q**: Does the model apply to collaborative works?
   **A**: Yes, collaborative works can implement the model with shared Process and Surface layers while maintaining individual Core layers for each contributor's private thoughts about the collaboration.
